## Entities

1. Player: he's the one who plays the game, have a capital and want to increase it buying new business, getting money
from them clicking or doing it automatically hiring a manager.
He expects to earn money also while he's away so there should be a last_update timestamp mechanism to calculate
revenue while game's not opened.
We could say: that player has a name, pic, capital, business_list, last_time_opened

2. Business: there are several types, but they have in common same props, only values can change.
They can produce money if you "sell" (click) the product or you hire a manager that essentially clicks for you.
They have a cost, they have a level, they have a min time to produce money that can change based to level, they can be managed by a manager
they can produce money also when user's away
We could say that business has: name, pic, initial_cost, state (busy or available to be clicked), has_manager, time_to_complete, levels, (each levels has a cost, time to produce the money, a qnty of money produced)

3. Managers: they own a Business and their job is to click for you, they have a business id and a cost.

## Components

We should have a main screen, with all business available, and a lateral menu where's possible to buy managers. 
In the top bar we can have a profile pic and the amount of money available.
